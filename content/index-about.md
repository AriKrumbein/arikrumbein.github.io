# Hi, I'm Ari. 

This is my little site for sharing what's on my mind.

I'm a software engineer working on Windows User Experiences.

Outside of work, I have *far* too many interests and not enough attention to satisfy any of them.

These days, I enjoy rowing crew, [designing and 3D printing](https://www.thingiverse.com/ari_krumbein/designs), and reading.
