Hello and welcome to Episode 1 of... whatever this blog is called.

I created this space because, to quote my friend Dustin, [I felt it was time to have the sort of website an adult who has a bunch of interesting things going on might have.](https://www.howett.net/projects/www.howett.net/)

I'm not quite sure what this website is going to be just yet. 
- I anticipate that the topics will be pretty eclectic.
- There will probably be *massive* gaps in between when I decide to publish stuff. 
- I'll probably wax heavily on life with ADHD, 3D Printing, and whatever hobby happens to catch my fancy at the time.

Watch this space! ðŸ˜Š
